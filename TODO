- finish/cleanup my small design change (add title) and commit it
- articles/tutorials/books/... (publications)
- convert all print, print, print sequences -> echo <<<EOT
- fix global variables / register globals problem
- use quotes for array indexes

- CSSify deprecated stuff
- use quotes for HTML attributes even when not stricly needed

- move containtags, isempty, OPTION, months to one include file accessible
  from all files

- update PostreSQL functions, depending on PHP version (to check with Sam)
    * pg_exec() -> pg_query(), if PHP >= 4.2 
    * pg_numrows() -> pg_num_rows(), if PHP >= 4.2
    * pg_result() -> pg_fetch_result(), if PHP >= 4.2
    * pg_fetch_array($result, $i, PGSQL_ASSOC) -> pg_fetch_assoc, if PHP >= 4.3
      maybe I should use pg_fetch_all()
? use pg_freeresult() when the result is not used anymore
? use pg_close (or the new name?)

- rewrite the whole thing using a premade framework, such as Turbo Gears...
  (this probably won't happen, because of lack of time, even though it should 
  be done)
