This is my TODO list for libsdl.org development.

- finish/cleanup my small design change (add title) and commit it
- convert all print, print, print sequences -> echo <<<EOT
- fix global variables / register globals problem
- use quotes for array indexes
- convert all HTML tags to lowercase, so that one day we can switch to XHTML
- use quotes for HTML attributes even when not stricly needed

- articles/tutorials/books/... (publications)

- use POST instead of GET for updateXXX (use input hidden) and deleteXXX
- CSSify deprecated stuff
- cleanup current CSS, I did it on a hurry...
- try validating all pages as HTML 4.01 Strict...

- move containtags, isempty, OPTION, months to one include file accessible
  from all files

- use template system (smarty seems nice)
- rewrite the whole thing. This probably won't happen, because of lack of time.
  But it should be done anyway... Why? because the current code is awfully
  repetitive, and is a bit of a nightmare to maintain/expand.

  The rewrite could be done either:
    * using a premade framework, such as Turbo Gears
    OR
    * using nothing but PHP again. Just using an OO approach with inheritance 
      should cut down the code in more than half
