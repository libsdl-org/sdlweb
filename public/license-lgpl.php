<h1>Licensing the Simple DirectMedia Layer library</h1>

<blockquote class="graytext">

<p>
The Simple DirectMedia Layer library is currently available under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
</a> version 2.1 or newer.
</p>

<p>
SDL's use of the LGPL is twofold:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Allow end users to use custom versions of the library, to support bug
     fixes and other enhancements.
<li> Allow any improvements made to the library for one project to benefit the
     community as a whole.
</ul>


<p>
To comply with this license, you must give prominent notice that you use
the Simple DirectMedia Layer library, and that it is included under the
terms of the LGPL license.  You must provide a copy of the LGPL license.
<br>
You must also do <strong>one</strong> of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Link with the library as a shared object (e.g. SDL.dll or libSDL.so)
<li> Provide the object or source code to your application along with any
     libraries and custom tools not available with a standard platform
     development kit.  You may also simply provide a written offer, valid
     for three years, to provide these materials upon request to anyone
     with a legal copy of your application.
</ol>

<p>
If you include the SDL library in binary form, you should also make
available the source code to the version you provide, including any
customizations you have made.  If you link to a standard version of
the library, simply referring to the SDL website is sufficient.
</p>
