<h1>SDL Subversion snapshots</h1>

<p>
SDL is now available via <a href="hg.php">Mercurial</a>.
</p>
<p>
The subversion repository and webview are available for historical purposes (as there are lots of URLs and references to svn revision numbers floating around), but development does not happen there any more.
