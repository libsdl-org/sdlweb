<h1>SDL Subversion snapshots</h1>

<p>
SDL is now available via <a href="hg.php">Mercurial</a>. The svn server and
 webview are available for historical purposes (as there are lots of URLs
 and references to svn revision numbers floating around), but development
 does not happen there any more. Use Mercurial instead.
